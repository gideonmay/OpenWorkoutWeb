Workout tracking website and companion to the Straen mobile app

## Rationale
Why develop a workout tracker when there are so many closed-source options available?
* I needed a companion website to the mobile app of the same name that I developed. I needed this to make the live tracking feature possible.
* Other workout trackers do not support strength-based exercises, such as pull-ups and push-ups (press-ups).
* I think users should have control over their own data and this is only possible with an open source application.

## Major Features
* Enables the live tracking feature of the Straen mobile app.
* Supports strength (lifting) activities as well as distance (aerobic) activities.

## Major Todos
* Support for strength-based activities.
* Activity export.
* Continuous scrolling for the activity feed.
* Import from other services.
* Better graphics.
* Replace Google Maps with Open Street Map.
