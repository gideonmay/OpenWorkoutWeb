Workout tracking website and companion to the Straen mobile app

## Rationale
Why develop a workout tracker when there are so many closed-source options available?
* I needed a companion website to the mobile app of the same name that I developed. I needed this to make the live tracking feature possible.
* Other workout trackers do not support strength-based exercises, such as pull-ups and push-ups (press-ups).
* I think users should have control over their own data and this is only possible with an open source application.

## Major Features
* Enables the live tracking feature of the Straen mobile app.
